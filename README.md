# Learning how to do all the jQuery things without jQuery!

jQuery is a blessing and a curse. It provides a *simple* API to query and manipulate the DOM which provides a super simple way for beginners to start using javascript.

I do lots of mentoring with [coding programs/bootcamps]() and most beginner devs don't actually realize that jQuery and javascript are different things!

I was in that same boat, along with many people in their first year of learning programming and javascript, and if you are working with a junior engineer, do not be certain that they fully understand this relationship...

# Purpose

To provide code examples of how to do all-things-jQuery, **without jQuery**.
