#### Sorry, we do not have code examples for implementing [clone](http://api.jquery.com/clone/) in vanilla javascript.

It would be great if you submitted code on [github](https://github.com/blairanderson/without-jquery/blob/master/docs/clone.md)

### Example:

```javascript
  //jQuery
  var i = clone(taco);

  //Javascript
  var i = document[somethingOtherThanclone](taco);

```

**REASONS:**
> Faster, and creates an event upon xyz

*example is computer generated, obviously not real.*
