title: jQuery.each() in Javascript - without jQuery
description: A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a functionâ€™s arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties.
method: jQuery.each

#### Sorry, we do not have code examples for implementing [jQuery.each](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/) in vanilla javascript.

It would be great if you submitted code on [github](https://github.com/blairanderson/without-jquery/blob/master/docs/jQuery.each.md)

### Example:

```javascript
  //jQuery
  var i = jQuery.each(taco);

  //Javascript
  var i = document[somethingOtherThanjQuery.each](taco);

```

**REASONS:**
> Faster, and creates an event upon xyz

*example is computer generated, obviously not real.*
