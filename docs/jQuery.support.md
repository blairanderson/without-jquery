title: jQuery.support in Javascript - without jQuery
description: A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. Intended for jQuery’s internal use; specific properties may be removed when they are no longer needed internally to improve page startup performance. For your own project’s feature-detection needs, we strongly recommend the use of an external library such as Modernizr instead of dependency on properties in jQuery.support.

#### Sorry, we do not have code examples for implementing [jQuery.support](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/) in vanilla javascript.

It would be great if you submitted code on [github](https://github.com/blairanderson/without-jquery/blob/master/docs/jQuery.support.md)

### Example:

```javascript
  //jQuery
  var i = jQuery.support(taco);

  //Javascript
  var i = document[somethingOtherThanjQuery.support](taco);

```

**REASONS:**
> Faster, and creates an event upon xyz

*example is computer generated, obviously not real.*
