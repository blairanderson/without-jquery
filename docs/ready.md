#### Sorry, we do not have code examples for implementing [ready](http://api.jquery.com/ready/) in vanilla javascript.

It would be great if you submitted code on [github](https://github.com/blairanderson/without-jquery/blob/master/docs/ready.md)

### Example:

```javascript
  //jQuery
  var i = ready(taco);

  //Javascript
  var i = document[somethingOtherThanready](taco);

```

**REASONS:**
> Faster, and creates an event upon xyz

*example is computer generated, obviously not real.*
